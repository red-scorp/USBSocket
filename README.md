# USBSocket project

USB Socket board came into existence as alternative to cheap miniUSB adapters which we not good enough for me.
These cheap boards do not care about D+/D- traced being equally long which is essential for USB wiring.
I had to design my own microUSB adapter board to fit my needs.

Following types of boards are available:

- **Type1** is breadboard friendly **microUSB** socket
- **Type2** is cable mount friendly **microUSB** socket
- **Type3** is breadboard friendly **miniUSB** socket
- **Type4** is cable mount friendly **miniUSB** socket
- **Type5** is breadboard friendly **USB** socket
- **Type6** is cable mount friendly **USB** socket
